# Cloud handoff

Everything an agent needs to start the MVP in the cloud without asking questions.

## Repository facts

| Item            | Value                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repo            | `official-manef/codex-clone-placeholder` (fork of `rahmanef63/codex-clone-placeholder`)   |
| Base template   | `rahmanef63/template-svelte-convex-starter` @ `eead6b5`                                   |
| Package manager | Bun — `bun.lock` only; `package.json` engines `>=1.4.2 <2`, `packageManager` `bun@1.4.2`  |
| Stack           | Svelte 5.57, SvelteKit 2.70, Tailwind 4.3, shadcn-svelte 1.5, TypeScript 6.0, Convex 1.45 |
| Feature alias   | `$features` → `./slices`                                                                  |
| Entry route     | `/` renders the workspace shell directly; there is no `/workspace` route                  |
| Production      | https://ai.manef.dev                                                                      |
| Vercel project  | `manef-console` in team `anti-nrml` (`prj_r770qRs42bfDtH1a3ylbTNfRgJoE`)                  |

`ai.manef.dev` is the address for this fork. It is a CNAME to Vercel with the Cloudflare
proxy disabled, because Let's Encrypt needs the request to reach Vercel directly. The
`manef.dev` zone lives in the MANEF Cloudflare account; the record is
`ai` → `9500417f5f907ec2.vercel-dns-017.com`, alongside the TXT record Vercel uses for
domain verification at `_vercel.manef.dev`.

The earlier row here named `https://codex-clone-placeholder.vercel.app` as the deployed
preview. That deployment belongs to the upstream repository, not this fork, and it has
also moved past the `/workspace` route family. Treat it as reference only.

The shell owns navigation through state, so `/`, `/capabilities` and `/settings` are not
routes. `bun run test:e2e` no longer has `tests/workspace.e2e.ts` or `tests/acceptance.e2e.ts`
to run; those were removed with the route family in `6ed1f3e`. See
[progress.md](progress.md) for the corrected acceptance status.

Vercel deploys here come from the CLI, not from a GitHub connection: the Vercel↔GitHub
integration returns `401` for this account, so `vercel link` cannot bind the repository and
a push to `main` does not start a build. Deploy, then verify the deployment is `READY`
before reporting a release:

```sh
source ~/.config/si-coder/connections/antinrml/vercel/default.env
bunx vercel deploy --prod --yes --scope anti-nrml
```

## Cloud environment setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rahmanef63/codex-clone-placeholder.git
cd codex-clone-placeholder
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check          # baseline must be green before any change
bun run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

No `.env` is required. `DEPLOY_TARGET` defaults to `vercel`; use `DEPLOY_TARGET=node` for
container targets. Convex connection stays unset in MVP — `PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` absent means
the shell runs fully client-side.

If a container or CI runner lacks `zip` or a Docker sandbox image, note it in the PR
instead of weakening a test.

## Guardrails the cloud agent must not break

**P0**

- No credentials, tokens or per-user mutable state in a module singleton or shared server
  module. Request state is contextual.
- Optional capabilities (auth, AI, MCP, payments, email, cloud) stay disabled; the shell
  must boot without them.
- Provider/model/tool output is untrusted. MVP has none — do not add a demo that calls a
  provider.
- Never publish a package. Deploy evidence must come from the deployed revision, not an
  old alias response.

**P1**

- Runes/modern syntax only; `scripts/check-svelte5.mjs` is the gate.
- Consumer UI in root `slices/<slug>/`; routes stay thin; cross-slice import is the barrel.
- One dynamic route per repeated page family, backed by a typed registry.
- shadcn-svelte primitives, semantic theme tokens, no hex in components.
- Mobile-first responsive; workspace surfaces are full-bleed `h-dvh`.
- One outer chrome. `app-shell` owns it; areas mount inside.
- Tests co-located per slice; app-level Playwright stays in `tests/`.
- Conventional commits plus `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

Any P1 that truly cannot be honored needs `// TODO(rr): <why + compliant shape>` at the
site and a line in the commit body. A P0 conflict means stop and report.

## First three commits (suggested)

```text
docs(product): add workspace shell PRD, state model, UI spec and handoff
chore(slices): retire starter demo slices and rewrite destination registry
feat(app-shell): add rail, sidebar host, overlay host and workspace routes
```

## Verification before handing back

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run verify
bunx playwright test
bun run test:dev
bun run assets:check
```

Then state, in the handoff message: commit SHA, which ACs are covered with which test,
which compositions were checked at which widths, and every deviation with its
`TODO(rr)` marker. Typecheck alone is not evidence.

## What is still open

- Acceptance criteria are all browser-verified: AC01–AC18 are covered by
  `tests/workspace.e2e.ts` and `tests/acceptance.e2e.ts` against local asynchronous stubs.
- What remains open is everything that needs a real backend: persistence beyond
  sessionStorage, authentication, uploads, and streaming providers.
- The product decisions in [PRD §9](PRD.md#9-open-decisions-block-product-copy-not-the-mvp-shell)
  (identity and copy, tab kinds and ownership, platform, authorization, attachment limits,
  settings source) are still unanswered.

## What is deliberately absent

Auth, database writes, streaming, upload, search, usage history, analytics, i18n switching,
marketing pages, and any real product copy. Do not fill these gaps to "make it feel
complete" — the empty slots are the deliverable.
